# Caffe_DoReFa
Ongoing work that tries to re-implement DoReFa-Net in Caffe according to https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/DoReFa-Net and https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06160

Implemented tasks:
- (1) Add new layer for weights quantization
- (2) Add new layer for activation quantization
- (3) CPU version of above tasks

To-Do List:
- (1) GPU version of implmented tasks
- (2) Quantization of gradient in backward pass
- (3) Convolutional bit-operation according to e.q.(3)

Any suggestions and helps for this task are highly appreciated!


Following is orginal README of Caffe
# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.

Check out the [project site](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) for all the details like
